Assignment 4 Progress Report
Amber Smith (as75287) and Joseph Xia (jx2598)

We've got the skeleton to show up on the screen, and also created a tree struct for bones that starts at the root bone.
We rendered the cylinder with scale working and orientation almost working and have very buggy bonepicking based on mouse 
position. Our plan is to finish bone picking by the end of this week so that we can move on to bone movement and rotation 
using recursion over the weekend and into next week.

We pair programmed the whole time.
